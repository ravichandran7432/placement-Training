        <h1>Rohit Sharma's Test captaincy faces its first huge test</h1>
        <img src="Images/img1.jpg">
        <p>It's made a spluttering sort of start in Test cricket: Rohit missed three
            of India's five Tests since he became their all-format captain. Injuries,
            in fact, have forced Rohit to miss eight of India's last 10 Test matches.
            He was Player of the Match in India's last Test before this stretch of
            games, a landmark victory that took them to a 2-1 series lead in
            England, months after they had beaten Australia 2-1 in Australia.</p>

        <img src="Images/img2.jpg">
        <p>Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood is set to miss the first Test
            against India in Nagpur with an Achilles niggle in his left leg,
        and is doubtful for the second Test in Delhi as well.</p>
        <h1>Australia aware of reverse-swing threat amid spin talk</h1>
        <p>Australia are prepared for moments where batting could become
            chaotic against India, but will also enter the series with an open mind
            amid all the talk about the role spin could play.</p>
         <h1>Charlotte Edwards to coach Mumbai's WPL team</h1> 
         <img src="Images/img3.jpg">
         <p>Edwards will be part of an all-woman coaching staff that also
            includes former India captain Jhulan Goswami, who will be
            mentor and bowling coach of the franchise that was bought
            by owners of the Mumbai Indians. Devika Palshikar, the former
            India allrounder, has been named batting coach.</p>
